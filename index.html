<!--"Summary" pages/s on your core project pitch/proposal
"Marketplace" page/s with research on the industry, your competitors, etc.
"Team" page/s that stress the roles and project-crucial strengths of each member (for the business venture, not the Coding1 project).
"The deal" page/s with information on the proposal for funding. What are the projections and the deal terms?
This website should be designed "mobile first"... i.e. the site should be optimized for a phone/small device. BUT, it should still adapt to larger screens.
Use the research, insights and ideas from your lean canvas and customer personas in ACAD 182
Note: The part 2 sub-site is intended as a private site for investors (not a public website). You do not have to do anything special in your coding, but you can act as if the site is password-protected/secured, and post information you might not normally want to be "public". 
The completed site should be hosted on the aludra space of ONE of the group members, but EVERY member should have a link to the assignment from their classpage.-->
